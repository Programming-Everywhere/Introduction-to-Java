2.2 How do you write a statement to let the user enter a double value from the keyboard?
What happens if you entered 5a when executing the following code?
double radius = input.nextDouble();

1) System.out.print("Write a double value: ");
2) runtime error

2.3 Are there any performance differences between the following two import statements?

import java.util.*;

No

2.4 Which of the following identifiers are valid? Which are Java keywords?

miles, Test, a++, ––a, 4#R, $4, #44, apps
class, public, int, x, y, radius

Valid: 
miles, Test, $4,apps,x, y, radius

2.5 public class Test {
	2 public static void main(String[] args) {
	3    int i = k + 2;
	4    System.out.println(i);
	5    }

answer: K is not declared or assigned a value.



2.6 Identify and fix the errors in the following code:
1 public class Test {
	2 public static void main(String[] args) {
	3 int i = j = k = 2;
	4 System.out.println(i + " " + j + " " + k);
5 }

 int i = 2, j =2, k = 2;

2.7 What are the benefits of using constants? Declare an int constant SIZE with value 20.

* 1) easy to read
* 2) no need to change all the time, only 1 time
* 3) no need to type reapeatly

variables? Which of the following items can be a constant, a method, a variable, or a
class according to the Java naming conventions?

* 1)class names: Capital 1st letter
* 2)method names, variables: lowercase, but camalCase id two words
* 3) contant: all UPPERCASE

2.9 Translate the following algorithm into Java code:
Step 1: Declare a double variable named miles with initial value 100.
Step 2: Declare a double constant named KILOMETERS_PER_MILE with value
1.609.
Step 3: Declare a double variable named kilometers, multiply miles and
KILOMETERS_PER_MILE, and assign the result to kilometers.
Step 4: Display kilometers to the console.
What is kilometers after Step 4?

	```java
	double miles = 100.0;
	final double KILOMETERS_PER_MILE = 1.609;
	double kilometers = miles * KILOMETERS_PER_MILE;

	System.out.println(kilometers);
	// 160.9

	```

1 % 5 = 1


2.12 If today is Tuesday, what will be the day in 100 days?

Sunday = 0, Monday = 1.....Saturday = 7
100 % 7 = 2
Tuesday + 2 = Thursday 


2.13 What is the result of 25 / 4? How would you rewrite the expression if you wished
the result to be a floating-point number?

25 / 4 = 5

25.0 / 4 = 5.0



2.14 Show the result of the following code:
System.out.println(2 * (5 / 2 + 5 / 2));
= 8

System.out.println(2 * 5 / 2 + 2 * 5 / 2);
=10

System.out.println(2 * (5 / 2));
=5

System.out.println(2 * 5 / 2);
= 5


2.15 Are the following statements correct? If so, show the output.
System.out.println("25 / 4 is " + 25 / 4);
yes, 25 / 4 is 6

System.out.println("25 / 4.0 is " + 25 / 4.0);
yes 25 / 4.0 is 6.25

System.out.println("3 * 2 / 4 is " + 3 * 2 / 4);
yes 3 * 2 / 4 is 1

System.out.println("3.0 * 2 / 4 is " + 3.0 * 2 / 4);
3.0 * 2 / 4 is 1.5



2.16 Write a statement to display the result of 23.5.

System.out.println(Math.pow(2, 3.5));

2.17 Suppose m and r are integers. Write a Java expression for mr2 to obtain a floatingpoint
result.
m * Math.pow(r, 2);

b. 5.5 * (r + 2.5)2.5 + t


2.23 How do you obtain the current second, minute, and hour?
Answer: System.currentTimeMillis()
this will be the milliseconds as a long value. 
long totalSeconds = milliseconds / 1000
long currentSecond = totalSeconds % 60
long totalMin = totalSeconds % 60
long currentMin = totalMin % 60
long totalHour = totalMin / 60
long currntHour = totalHour % 24

time: currentHour + currentMin + currentSecond

Answer:
7.5
3.0

2.25 Which of these statements are true?
a. Any expression can be used as a statement.
b. The expression x++ can be used as a statement.

b
c

2.26 Show the output of the following code:
int a = 6;
int b = a++;

7
6

7
7


2.27 Can different types of numeric values be used together in a computation?
Yes. 3/0.2


2.28 What does an explicit casting from a double to an int do with the fractional part of
the double value? Does casting change the variable being cast?
(int)2.5 = 2
yes
2.29 Show the following output:
float f = 12.5F;
int i = (int)f;
System.out.println("f is " + f);
System.out.println("i is " + i);
f is 12.5F
i is 12

2.30 If you change (int)(tax * 100) / 100.0 to (int)(tax * 100) / 100 in line
