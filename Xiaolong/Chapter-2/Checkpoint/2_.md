2.2 How do you write a statement to let the user enter a double value from the keyboard?
What happens if you entered 5a when executing the following code?
double radius = input.nextDouble();

1) System.out.print("Write a double value: ");
2) runtime error

2.3 Are there any performance differences between the following two import statements?
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.*;

No

2.4 Which of the following identifiers are valid? Which are Java keywords?

miles, Test, a++, ––a, 4#R, $4, #44, apps
class, public, int, x, y, radius

Valid: 
miles, Test, $4,apps,x, y, radius

2.5 public class Test {
	2 public static void main(String[] args) {
	3    int i = k + 2;
	4    System.out.println(i);
	5    }
	6 }

answer: K is not declared or assigned a value.



2.6 Identify and fix the errors in the following code:
1 public class Test {
	2 public static void main(String[] args) {
	3 int i = j = k = 2;
	4 System.out.println(i + " " + j + " " + k);
5 }

 int i = 2, j =2, k = 2;

2.7 What are the benefits of using constants? Declare an int constant SIZE with value 20.

* 1) easy to read
* 2) no need to change all the time, only 1 time
* 3) no need to type reapeatly


2.8 What are the naming conventions for class names, method names, constants, and
variables? Which of the following items can be a constant, a method, a variable, or a
class according to the Java naming conventions?
MAX_VALUE, Test, read, readDouble

* 1)class names: Capital 1st letter
* 2)method names, variables: lowercase, but camalCase id two words
* 3) contant: all UPPERCASE

2.9 Translate the following algorithm into Java code:
Step 1: Declare a double variable named miles with initial value 100.
Step 2: Declare a double constant named KILOMETERS_PER_MILE with value
1.609.
Step 3: Declare a double variable named kilometers, multiply miles and
KILOMETERS_PER_MILE, and assign the result to kilometers.
Step 4: Display kilometers to the console.
What is kilometers after Step 4?

	```java
	double miles = 100.0;
	final double KILOMETERS_PER_MILE = 1.609;
	double kilometers = miles * KILOMETERS_PER_MILE;

	System.out.println(kilometers);
	// 160.9

	```


2.10 Find the largest and smallest byte, short, int, long, float, and double. Which
of these data types requires the least amount of memory?
largest: Long
Smallest: byte

Byte -127 ~ 128

2.11 Show the result of the following remainders.
56 % 6 = 2
78 % -4 = -2
-34 % 5 = -4
-34 % -5 - 4
5 % 1 = 0
1 % 5 = 1


2.12 If today is Tuesday, what will be the day in 100 days?

Sunday = 0, Monday = 1.....Saturday = 7
100 % 7 = 2
Tuesday + 2 = Thursday 


2.13 What is the result of 25 / 4? How would you rewrite the expression if you wished
the result to be a floating-point number?

25 / 4 = 5

25.0 / 4 = 5.0



2.14 Show the result of the following code:
System.out.println(2 * (5 / 2 + 5 / 2));
= 8

System.out.println(2 * 5 / 2 + 2 * 5 / 2);
=10

System.out.println(2 * (5 / 2));
=5

System.out.println(2 * 5 / 2);
= 5


2.15 Are the following statements correct? If so, show the output.
System.out.println("25 / 4 is " + 25 / 4);
yes, 25 / 4 is 6

System.out.println("25 / 4.0 is " + 25 / 4.0);
yes 25 / 4.0 is 6.25

System.out.println("3 * 2 / 4 is " + 3 * 2 / 4);
yes 3 * 2 / 4 is 1

System.out.println("3.0 * 2 / 4 is " + 3.0 * 2 / 4);
3.0 * 2 / 4 is 1.5



2.16 Write a statement to display the result of 23.5.

System.out.println(Math.pow(2, 3.5));

2.17 Suppose m and r are integers. Write a Java expression for mr2 to obtain a floatingpoint
result.
m * Math.pow(r, 2);

2.18 How many accurate digits are stored in a float or double type variable?
float: 8
double: 16

2.19 Which of the following are correct literals for floating-point numbers?

12.3, 12.3e+2, 23.4e-2, –334.4, 20.5, 39F, 40D
All of them

2.20 Which of the following are the same as 52.534?
5.2534e+1, 0.52534e+2, 525.34e-1, 5.2534e+0

5.2534e+1, 0.52534e+2,525.34e-1, 5.2534e+0

2.21 Which of the following are correct literals?
5_2534e+1, _2534, 5_2, 5_
None

2.22 How would you write the following arithmetic expression in Java?
a.
4
3(r + 34) - 9(a + bc) +
3 + d(2 + a)
a + bd
b. 5.5 * (r + 2.5)2.5 + t


2.23 How do you obtain the current second, minute, and hour?
