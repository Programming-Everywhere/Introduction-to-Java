2.1 Identify and fix the errors in the following code:
```java 
 public class Test {
  public void main(string[] args) {
    double i = 50.0;
    double k = i + 50.0;
    double j = k + 1;

    System.out.println("j is " + j + " and  k is " + k);
 }
```
1) public static void main(String[] args) 
2) String[] 

output:
// i = 50.0 k = 100.0 j = 101.0
j is 101.0 and k is 100.0
