#Questions:

1.42 What are syntax errors (compile errors), runtinme errors, and logic errors?
-Syntax Errors: a character or string incorrectly placed in a command or instruction 
that causes a failure in execution.
-Runtime Errors: are errors that cause a program to terminate abnormally
-Logic Errors: occur when a program does not perform the way it was intended to. 
-Input Error: occurs when the program is waiting for the user to enter a vaule, but the user 
enters a vaule that the program cannot handle.

1.43 Give examples of syntax errors, runtime errors and logic errors.
-Syntax Error: ("Welcome to Java!)
-Runtime Error: Division by Zero, this happens when the divisor is zero for integer
division.  ex. System.out.printIn(1/0)
-Logic Error: . For example, assigning a value to the wrong variable may cause a 
series of unexpected program errors. Multiplying two numbers instead of adding 
them together may also produce unwanted results


1.44 If you forgt to put a closing quotation mark on a string, what kind of error
will be raised?

Syntax Error

1.45 If your program needs to read integers, but the user entered strings, an error
would occur when running this program. What kind of error is this?

Runtime Error

1.46 Suppose you write a program for computing the perimeter of a rectangle and you
mistakenly write your program so that it computes the area of a rectangle. What kind
of error is this?

Logic Error

1.47 Identify and fix the errors in the following code:

1 public class Welcome {
2   public void main(String[] args) {
3     System.out.printIn("Welcome to Java!");
4     }
