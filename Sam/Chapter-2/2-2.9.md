Chapter 2-2.9 Check Points

2.1  Identify and fix the errors in the following code:
  public class Test {
     public void main(string[] args) {
       double i = 50.0;
       double k = i + 50.0;
       double j = k + 1;
 
       System.out.println("j is " + j + " and
         k is " + k);
     }
  }
Line 

-Line 2 is missing static for the main method
-Line 2 the string should be String 
-Lines 7-8 the string cant be broken into two lines


2.2 How do you  write a statement to let the use enter a double 
value from the keyboard? What happens if you entered 5a when 
executing the following code?

double = raidus = input.nextDouble();

-We're going to use:

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
double value = input.nextDouble();

*A runtime error will happen if you enter 5a when executing
this code:

-double radius = input.nextDouble();


2.3   Are there any performance differences between the following two import
statements?


-Single Class:   import java.util.Scanner;
-Imports all Classes: import java.util.*;


2.4 Which of the following identifiers are valid? Which are
Java Keywords?


miles, Test, a++, -aa, 4#R, $4, #44, apps

Valid Identifiers are:
miles, Test, $4, apps, x, y, radius

Invalid Identifiers are:

a++, --a, 4#R, #44, class, public, int

Keywords are: class, public, int



2.5 Identify and fix the erros in the following code:

 public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int i = k + 2;
      System.out.println(i);
    }


On line 3 k is undefined



2.6 Identify and fix the erros in the following code:
  
  public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int i = j = k = 2;
      System.out.println(i + " " + j + " " + k);
    }
  }

 the statement int i = j = k = 2 in line 3 only declares i. j 
and k are not declared. The following line would declare i, j, and k:


int i, j, k;
To fix the error, change line 3 to
int j, k;
int i = j = k = 2;
or
int i = 2;
int j = 2;
int k = 2;
or
int i = 2, j = 2, k = 2;



2.7  What are the benefits of using constants? Declare an int
constant SIZE with the value 20.


The three benefits are :
- You dont have to repeatedly type the same value
-The value can be changed in a single location
-The program is easier to read


final int SIZE = 20;


2.8  What are the naming conventions for class names,
method names, constants, and variables? Which of the
following items can be a constant, a method, a variable, 
or a class according to the Java naming conventions?

MAX_VALUE, Test, read, readDouble



2.9 Translate the following algorithm into Java code:
Translate the following algorithm into Java code:
Step 1: Declare a double variable named miles with initial value 100.
Step 2: Declare a double constant named KILOMETERS_PER_MILE with value 1.609.
Step 3: Declare a double variable named kilometers, multiply miles and KILOMETERS_PER_MILE, and assign the result to kilometers.
Step 4: Display kilometers to the console.
What is kilometers after Step 4?

double miles = 100;
final double KILOMETERS_PER MILE = 1.609;
double kilometers = KILOMETERS_PER MILE * miles;
System.out.println(kilometers);
The value of kilometers is 160.9

2.9.1 Find the largest and smallest byte, short, int, 
long, float, and double. Which of these data types 
requires the least amount of memory?

byte: from -128 to 127, inclusive
short: from -32768 to 32767, inclusive
int: from -2147483648 to 2147483647, inclusive
long: from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
float: the smallest positive float is 1.40129846432481707e-45 
and the largest float is 3.40282346638528860e+38
For double, the smallest positive double is 
4.94065645841246544e-324 and the largest double is 1.79769313486231570e+308d

2.9.2  Show the result of the following remainders.
56 % 6 : 2
78 % -4 : 2
-34 % 5 : -4
-34 % -5 : -4
5 % 1 : 0
1 % 5 : 1

2.9.3 If today is Tuesday, what will be the day in 100 days?

(2 + 100) % 7 = 4. So it is Thursday.



2.9.4  What is the result of 25 / 4? 
How would you rewrite the expression if you wished the 
result to be a floating-point number?

25 / 4 =  6 

Floating-point number, rewrite it as 25.0 / 4.0, 25.0 / 4, or 25 / 4.0.


2.9.5 Show the result of the following code:
System.out.println(2 * (5 / 2 + 5 / 2));
System.out.println(2 * 5 / 2 + 2 * 5 / 2);
System.out.println(2 * (5 / 2));
System.out.println(2 * 5 / 2);

5



2.9.6 Are the following statements correct? If so, show the output.
System.out.println("25 / 4 is " + 25 / 4);
System.out.println("25 / 4.0 is " + 25 / 4.0);
System.out.println("3 * 2 / 4 is " + 3 * 2 / 4);
System.out.println("3.0 * 2 / 4 is " + 3.0 * 2 / 4);


Yes, the statements are correct. The output is
25 / 4 is 6
25 / 4.0 is 6.25
3 * 2 / 4 is 1
3.0 * 2 / 4 is 1.5


2.9.7 Write a Statement to display the result of 2 3.5 

Math.pow(2,3.5)

2.9.8  Suppose m and r are integers. Write a Java expression for mr 2 to obtain a floating-point result.

1.0 * m * (r*r)
