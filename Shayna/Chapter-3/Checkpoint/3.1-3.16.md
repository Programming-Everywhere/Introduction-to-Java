3.1
List six relational operators.

- <
- <=
- >
- >=
- ==
- !=

3.2
Assuming that x is 1, show the result of the following Boolean expressions:

- (x > 0) = true
  (x < 0) = false
  (x != 0) = true
  (x >= 0) = true
  (x != 1) = false

3.3
Can the following conversions involving casting be allowed? Write a test
program to verify your answer.

- Boolean values cannot be cast to other types.

3.4
Write an if statement that assigns 1 to x if y is greater than 0.

- if (y > 0)
    x = 1;

3.5
Write and if statement that increases pay by 3% is score is greater than 90.

- if (score > 90)
    pay *= 1.03;

3.6
Write and if statement that increases pay by 3% if score is greater than 90,
otherwise increases pay by 1%.

- if (score > 90)
    pay *= 1.03;
  else
    pay *= 1.01;

3.7
What is the output of the code in (a) and (b) if number is 30? What if
number is 35?

- If 30
  a. 30 is even.
     30 is odd.
  b. 30 is even.

- If 35
  a. 35 is odd.
  b. 35 is odd.

3.8
Suppose x = 3 and y = 2; show the output, if any, of the following code. 
What is the output if x = 3 and y = 4? What is the output if x = 2 and 
y = 2? 

- if x = 3 and y = 2:
  no output
- if x = 3 and y = 4:
  output = z is 7
- if x = 2 and y = 2:
  output = x is 2

3.9
Suppose x = 2 and y = 3. Show the output, if any, of the following code.
What is the output if x = 3 and y = 2? What is the output if x = 3 and
y = 3?

- if x = 2 and y = 3
  no output
- if x = 3 and y = 2
  output = x is 3
- if x = 3 and y = 3
  output = z is 6

3.10
What is wrong in the following code?

- Since we started off with lowest number as our first score, any score
  above 60 will not be evaluated, thus giving any scorea above 60 a D.

3.11
Which of the following statements are equivalent? Which ones are correctly
indented?

- a, c, d are equivalent
- b and c are correctly indented

3.12
Rewrite the following statement using a Boolean expression:

if (count % 10 == 0)
  newLine = true;
else
  newLine = false;

- boolean newLine = (count % 10 == 0);

3.13
Are the following statements correct? Which one is better?

- Both statments are correct, (b) is the preferred format.

3.14
What is the output of the following code if number is 14, 15, or 30?

- if 14
  (a) 14 is even
  (b) 14 is even
- if 15
  (a) 15 is a multiple of 5
  (b) 15 is a multiple of 5
- if 30
  (a) 30 is even
      30 is a multiple of 5
  (b) 30 is even

3.15
Which of the following is a possible output from invoking Math.random()?

- 0.5
  0.0
  0.234

3.16
a. How do you generate a random integer i such that 0 ≤ i < 20?
- (int)(Math.random() * 20);
b. How do you generate a random integer i such that 10 ≤ i < 20?
- 10 + (int)(Math.random() * 10);
c. How do you generate a random integer i such that 10 ≤ i ≤ 50?
- 10 + (int)(Math.random() * 40);
d. Write an expression that returns 0 or 1 randomly.
- (int)(Math.random() * 2);
