3.17
Are the following two statements equivalent?
- yes

3.18
Assuming that x is 1, show the result of the following Boolean expressions:

- (true) && (3 > 4) is false
- !(x > 0) && (x > 0) is false
- (x > 0) || (x < 0) is true
- (x != 0) || (x == 0) is true
- (x >= 0) || (x < 0) is true
- (x != 1) == !(x == 1) is true

3.19
(a)Write a Boolean expression that evaluates to true if a number stored in variable
num is between 1 and 100. (b) Write a Boolean expresssion that evaluates to true if
a number stored in variable num is between 1 and 100 or the number is negative.

- (a) (num > 1) && (num < 100)
- (b) (num > 1) && (num < 100) || < 0

3.20
(a) Write a Boolean expression for |x - 5| < 4.5. (b) Write a Boolean expression for
|x - 5| > 4.5.

- (a) (x - 5) < 4.5 && (x - 5) > -4.5
- (b) (x - 5) > 4.5 || (x - 5) < -4.5

3.21
Assume that x and y are int type. Which of the following are legal Java expressions?

- x > y > 0 is incorrect
- x = y && y is incorrect
- x /= y is correct
- x or y is incorrect
- (x != 0) || (x = 0) is incorrect

3.22
Are the following two expressions the same?
a. x % 2 == 0 && x % 3 == 0
b. x % 6 == 0

- Both expressions are the same.

3.23
What is the value of the expression x >= 50 && x <= 100 if x is 45, 67, or 101?

- if 45, expression is false
- if 67, expression is true
- if 101, expression is false

3.24
Suppose, when you run the following program, you enter the input 2 3 6 from the console.
What is the output?

- (x < y && y < z) is true
- (x < y || y < z) is true
- !(x < y) is false
- (x + y < z) is true
- (x + y > z) is false

3.25
Write a Boolean expression that evaluates to true if age is greater than 13 and less than 18.

- age > 13 && < 18

3.26
Write a Boolean expression that evaluates to true if weight is greater than 50 pounds or
height is greater than 60 inches.

- weight > 50 || height > 60

3.27
Write a Boolean expression that evaluates to true if weight is greater than 50 pounds and
height is greater than 60 inches.

- weight > 50 && height > 60.

3.28
Write a Boolean expression that evaluaates to true if either weight is greater than 50
pounds or height is greater than 60 inches, but not both.

- weight > 50 ^ height < 60

3.29
What data types are required for a switch variable? If the keyword break is not used after
a case is processed, what is the next statement to be executed? Can you convert a switch
statement to an equivalent if statement, or vice versa? What are the advantages of using
a switch statement?

- The switch-expression must yield a value of char, byte, short, int, or String type.
- If break is not used after case, the next case statement is performed.
- Switch statements can be converted into equivalent if statements, but if statements
  cannot be converted into switch statements.
- Switch statements simplify coding for multiple conditions.

3.30
What is y after the following switch statement is executed? Rewrite the code using an 
if-else statement.

- y equals to 2.
  x = 3; y = 3;
  if (x + 3 == 6) {
    y = 1;
  }
  y += 1;

3.31
What is x after the following if-else statement is executed? Use a switch statememt to
rewrite it and draw the flowchart for the new switch statement.

- x equals to 17
- switch (a) {
    case 1: x += 5; break;
    case 2: x += 10; break;
    case 3: x += 16; break;
    case 4: x += 34;
  }

3.32
Write a switch statement that displays Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, if day is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, accordingly.

- switch (day) {
    case 0: System.out.println("Sunday"); break;
    case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
    case 3: System.out.println("Wednesday"); break;
    case 4: System.out.println("Thursday"); break;
    case 5: System.out.println("Friday"); break;
    case 6: System.out.println("Saturday"); break;

3.33
Suppose that, when you run the following program, you enter the input 2 3 6 from the 
console. What is the output?

- sorted

3.34
Rewrite the following if statements using the conditional operator
if (ages >= 16)
  ticketPrice = 20;
else
  ticketPrice = 10;

- ticketPrice = (ages >= 16) ? 20 : 10;

3.35
Rewrite the following conditional expressions using if-else statements.
a. score = (x > 10) ? 3 * scale : 4 * scale;
b. tax = (income > 10000) ? income * 0.2 : income * 0.17 + 1000;
c. System.out.println((number % 3 == 0) ? i : j);

- a. if (x > 10) 
       score = 3 * scale;
     else
       score = 4 * scale;

- b. if (income > 10000) 
       tax = income * 0.2;
     else
       tax = income * 0.17 + 1000;

- c. if (number % 3 == 0)
       System.out.println(i);
     else
       System.out.println(j);

3.36
Write conditional expression that returns -1 or 1 randomly.

- (int)(Math.random() * 2) == 0 ? -1 : 1;

3.37
List the precedence order of the Boolean operators. Evaluate the following expressions:

- !, ^, &&, ||
- true || true && false is true
- true && true || false is true

3.38
True or false? All the binary operators except = are left associative.

- True

3.39
Evaluate the following expressions:
2 * 2 - 3 > 2 && 4 - 2 > 5
2 * 2 - 3 > 2 || 4 - 2 > 5

- Both expressions are false

3.40
Is (x > 0 && < 10) the same as ((x > 0) && (x < 10))? Is (x > 0 || x < 10) the same as
((x > 0) || (x < 10))? Is (x > 0 || x < 10 && y < 0) the same as (x > 0 || (x < 10 && 
y < 0))?
