2.18 How many accurate digits are stored in a float or double type variable?

Float Value = 7 to 8 digits
Double Value = 15 to 17 digits
2.19 Which of the following are correct literals for floating-point numbers? 12 , 3, 12.3e+2, 23.4e-2, -334.4, 20.5, 39F, 40D

All are correct literals.
2.20 Which of the following are the same as 52.534? 5.2534e+1, 0.52534e+2, 525.34e-1, 5.2534e+0

5.23534e+1, 0.52534e+2, 525.34e-1
2.21 Which of the following are correct literals? 5_2534e+1, 2534, 5_2, 5

5_2534e+1, 5_2
2.22 How would you write the following arithmetic expression in Java?

a. (4.0 / 3 * (r + 34)) - 9.0 * (a + bc) + (3 + d * (2 + a)) / (a + bd)

b. (5.5 * Math.pow(r + 2.5, 2.5 + t))

2.23 How do you obtain the current second, minute, and hour?

current second = total seconds % 60
current minute = total minutes % 60
current hour = total hours % 24
Compute by using the currentTimeMillis method
2.24 Show the output of the following code: double a = 6.5; a += a + 1;

7.5
3.0
2.25 Which of these statements are true?

B and C
2.26 Show the output of the following code:

7 6

7

7

2.27 Can different types of numeric values be used together in a computation?

Yes. This is done with casting, which is an operation that converts a value of one data type into a value of another data type.
2.28 What does an explicit casting from a double to an int do with the fractional part of the double value? Does casting change the variable being cast?

When a double value is cast into an int value, the fractional part is truncated.
Casting does not change the variable being cast.
2.29 Show the following output:

f is 12.5F
i is 12
2.30 If you change (int)(tax * 100) / 100.0 to (int)(tax * 100) / 100 in line 11 in Listing 2.8, what will be the output for the input purchase amount of 197.55?

11
2.31 Show the output of the following code:

2.5 2
2.32 How would you write the following arithmetic expression?

2.33 Show the output with the input value 1.99.

Enter an amount in double, for example 11.56: 1.99 Your amount 1.99 cosists of 1 dollars 3 quarters 2 dimes 0 nickels 4 pennies
2.34 Can you declare a variable as int and later redeclare it as a double?

No
2.35 What is integer overflow? Can floating-point operations cause overflow?

Integer overflow happens when a variable is assigned a value that is too large (in size) to be stored.
Floating point numbers do not cause overflow.
2.36 Will overflow cause a runtime error?

Java does not report warnings or errors on overflow.
2.37 What is a round-off error? Can integer operations cause round-off errors? Can floating-point operations cause round-off errors?

A round-off error, or rounding error, is the difference between the calculated approximation of a number and its exact mathematical value.
Integer operations do not cause round-off errors.
Floating-point numbers can cause round-off errors.
