2.1
Identify and fix the errors in the following code:

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double i = 50.0;
    double k = i + 50.0;
    double j = k + 1;
    System.out.println("j is " + j + " and k is " + k);
  }
}

2.2
How do you write a statement to let the user enter a double value from the keyboard?
What happens if you entered 5a when executing the following code?
double radius = input.nextDouble();

- Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
 double value = input.nextDouble();

- A runtime error would occur.

2.3
Are there any performance differences between the following two import statments?
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.*;

- The first statement is a specific import and the second is a wildcard import. The 
  specific import specifies a single class, while the wildcard import imports all the
  classes in a package by using the asterisk as the wildcard.
- There is no performace difference between a specific import and a wildcard import
  declaration

2.4
Which of the following identifiers are valid? Which are Java keywords?
miles, Test, a++, --a, 4#R, $4, #44, apps
class, public, int, x, y, radius

- Valid Identifiers: miles, Test, $4, apps, x, y, radius
- Invalid Identifiers: a++, --a, 4#R, #44
- Keywords: class, public, int

2.5
Identify and fix the errors in the following code:

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = k + 2;
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}

2.6
Identify and fix the errors in the following code:

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 2;
    int j = 2;
    int k = 2;
    System.out.println(i + " " + j + " " + k);
  }
}

2.7
What are the benefits of using constants? Declare an int constant SIZE with value 20.

- There are threee benefits of using constants:
  - you dont have to repeatedly type the same value if it is used multiple times
  - if you have to change the constant value you need to change it only in a single
    location in the source code
  - a descpriptive name for a constant makes the program easy to read

- final int SIZE = 20;

2.8
What are the naming conventions for class names, method names, constants, and variables?
Which of the following items can be a constant, a method, a variable, or a class
according to the Java naming conventions?

- Use lowercase for variables and methods. If a name consists of several words, 
  concatenate them into one, making the first words lowercase and capitilizing the first
  letter of each subsequent word
- Capitalize the first letter of each words in a class name
- Capitalize every letter in a constant, and use underscores between words
 - Constant = MAX_VALUE
 - Class = Test
 - Variable or method = read, readDouble

2.9
Translate the following algorithm inot Java code:

double miles = 100;
final double KILOMETERS_PER_MILE = 1.609
double kilometers = KILOMETERS_PER_MILE * miles;
System.out.println(kilometers);

Kilometers = 160.9

2.10
Find the largest and smallest byte, short, int, long, float, and double. Which of these
data types requires the least amount of memory?

-Smallest to largest:
 - byte -128 to 127
 - short -3278 to 32767
 - int -2147483648 to 2147483647
 - long -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
 - float 1.40129846432481707e-45,
        3.40282346638528860e+38,
 - double 4.94065645841246544e-324,
         1.79769313486231570e+308d

2.11
Show the result of the following remainders:

- 56 % 6 = 2
- 78 % -4 = 2
- -34 % 5 = -4
- -34 % -5 = -4
- 5 % 1 = 0
- 1 % 5 = 1

2.12
If today is Tuesday, what will be the day in 100 days?
- Thursday

2.13
What is the result of 25 / 4? How would yo rewrite the expression if you wished the
result to be a floating-point number?

- The result of 25 / 4 is 6.
- Rewrite as 25.0 / 4.0, 25.0 / 4, or 25 / 4.0 for a floating-point number result.

2.14
Show the result of the following code:

- 8
  10
  4
  5

2.15
Are the following statements correct? If so show the output.

25 / 4 is 6
25 / 4.0 is 6.25
3 * 2 / 4 is 1
3.0 * 2 / 4 is 1.5

2.16
Write a statement to display the result of 2 3.5.
Math.pow(2, 3.5)

2.17
Suppose m and r are integers. Write a Java expression for mr^2 to obtain a floating-
point result.
