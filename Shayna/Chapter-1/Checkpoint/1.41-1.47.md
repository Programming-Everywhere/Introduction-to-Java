Reformat the following program according to the programming style and
documentation guidelines. Use the end-of-line brace style.

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Java");
  } 
}

What are syntax errors (compile errors), runtime errors, and logic errors?
- Syntax errors are detected by the compiler as a result from errors in the
  codes construction.
- Runtime errors cause a program to terminate abnormally, and occur while a
  program is running if the environment detects an operation that is impossible
  to carry out. They are typically caused by input errors, which occur when the
  program is waiting for the user to enter a value, but the user enters a value
  that the program cannot handle.
- Logic errors occur when a program does not perfomr the wya it was intended to

1.43
Give examples of syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors.
- Syntax errors - Mistyping a keyword, omitting some necessary punctuation, 
                  using an opening brace without a corresponding closing brace
- Runtime errors - entering a string when the program expects a number,
                   using a divisor of zero
- Logic errors - assigning a value to the wrong variable, multiplying two 
                 numbers instead of adding, not including decimals 
                   
1.44
If you for forget to put a closing quotation mark on a string, what kind of
error will be raised?
- Syntax error

1.45
If your program needs to read integers, but the user entered strings, an error
would occur when running this program. What kind of error is this?
- Runtime error

1.46
Suppose you write a program for computing the perimeter of a rectangle and you
mistakenly write your program so that it computes the area of a rectangle. What
kind of error is this?
- Logic error

1.47
Identify and fix the errors in the following code:
public class Welcome {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
  }
}
